# Intelligent Router

## Quick Setup

**New to this skill?** Start here:

1. **Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json`** (or customize the included `config.json`)
2. **Edit `config.json`** to add your available models with their costs and tiers
3. **Test the CLI**: `python scripts/router.py classify "your task description"`
4. **Use in your agent**: Reference models from your config when spawning sub-agents

**Example config entry:**
```json
{
  "id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
  "alias": "Claude Sonnet",
  "tier": "COMPLEX",
  "input_cost_per_m": 3.00,
  "output_cost_per_m": 15.00,
  "capabilities": ["text", "code", "reasoning", "vision"]
}
```

## Overview

This skill teaches AI agents how to intelligently route sub-agent tasks to different LLM models based on task complexity, cost, and capability requirements. The goal is to **reduce costs by routing simple tasks to cheaper models while preserving quality for complex work**.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever you:
- Spawn sub-agents or delegate tasks to other models
- Need to choose between different LLM options
- Want to optimize costs without sacrificing quality
- Handle tasks with varying complexity levels
- Need to estimate costs before execution

## Core Routing Logic

### 1. Four-Tier Classification System

Tasks are classified into four tiers based on complexity and risk:

| Tier | Description | Example Tasks | Model Characteristics |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **🟢 SIMPLE** | Routine, low-risk operations | Monitoring, status checks, API calls, summarization | Cheapest available, good for repetitive tasks |
| **🟡 MEDIUM** | Moderate complexity work | Code fixes, research, small patches, data analysis | Balanced cost/quality, good general purpose |
| **🟠 COMPLEX** | Multi-component development | Feature builds, debugging, architecture, multi-file changes | High-quality reasoning, excellent code generation |
| **🔴 CRITICAL** | High-stakes operations | Security audits, production deploys, financial operations | Best available model, maximum reliability |

### 2. Model Selection Strategy

Configure your available models in `config.json` and assign them to tiers. The router will automatically recommend models based on task classification.

**Configuration pattern:**
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "{provider}/{model-name}",
      "alias": "Human-Friendly Name",
      "tier": "SIMPLE|MEDIUM|COMPLEX|CRITICAL",
      "provider": "anthropic|openai|google|local|etc",
      "input_cost_per_m": 0.50,
      "output_cost_per_m": 1.50,
      "context_window": 128000,
      "capabilities": ["text", "code", "reasoning", "vision"],
      "notes": "Optional notes about strengths/limitations"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Tier recommendations:**
- **SIMPLE tier**: Models under $0.50/M input, optimized for speed/cost
- **MEDIUM tier**: Models $0.50-$3.00/M input, good at coding/analysis
- **COMPLEX tier**: Models $3.00-$5.00/M input, excellent reasoning
- **CRITICAL tier**: Best available models, cost secondary to quality

### 3. Coding Task Routing (Important!)

**For coding tasks specifically:**

- **Simple code tasks** (lint fixes, small patches, single-file changes)
  - Use MEDIUM tier model as primary coder
  - Consider spawning a SIMPLE tier model as QA reviewer
  - **Cost check**: Only use coder+QA if combined cost < using COMPLEX tier directly

- **Complex code tasks** (multi-file builds, architecture, debugging)
  - Use COMPLEX or CRITICAL tier directly
  - Skip delegation — premium models are more reliable and cost-effective for complex work
  - QA review unnecessary when using top-tier models

**Decision flow for coding:**
```
IF task is simple code (lint, patch, single file):
  → {medium_model} as coder + optional {simple_model} QA
  → Only if (coder + QA cost) < {complex_model} solo

IF task is complex code (multi-file, architecture):
  → {complex_model} or {critical_model} directly
  → Skip delegation, skip QA — the model IS the quality
```

### 4. Usage Pattern

When spawning sub-agents, use the `model` parameter with IDs from your `config.json`:

```python
# Use the router CLI to classify first (optional but recommended)
# $ python scripts/router.py classify "check GitHub notifications"
# → Recommends: SIMPLE tier, {simple_model}

# Simple task — monitoring
sessions_spawn(
    task="Check GitHub notifications and summarize recent activity",
    model="{simple_model}",  # Use your configured SIMPLE tier model ID
    label="github-monitor"
)

# Medium task — code fix
sessions_spawn(
    task="Fix lint errors in utils.js and write changes to disk",
    model="{medium_model}",  # Use your configured MEDIUM tier model ID
    label="lint-fix"
)

# Complex task — feature development
sessions_spawn(
    task="Build authentication system with JWT, middleware, tests",
    model="{complex_model}",  # Use your configured COMPLEX tier model ID
    label="auth-feature"
)

# Critical task — security audit
sessions_spawn(
    task="Security audit of authentication code for vulnerabilities",
    model="{critical_model}",  # Use your configured CRITICAL tier model ID
    label="security-audit"
)
```

### 5. Cost Awareness

Understanding cost structures helps optimize routing decisions:

**Typical cost ranges per million tokens (input/output):**
- **SIMPLE tier**: $0.10-$0.50 / $0.10-$1.50
- **MEDIUM tier**: $0.40-$3.00 / $0.40-$15.00
- **COMPLEX tier**: $3.00-$5.00 / $1.30-$25.00
- **CRITICAL tier**: $5.00+ / $25.00+

**Cost estimation:**
```bash
# Estimate cost before running
python scripts/router.py cost-estimate "build authentication system"
# Output: Tier: COMPLEX, Est. cost: $0.024 USD
```

**Rule of thumb**: 
- High-volume repetitive tasks → cheaper models
- One-off complex critical work → premium models
- When in doubt → estimate cost of both options and compare

### 6. Fallback & Escalation Strategy

If a model produces unsatisfactory results:

1. **Identify the issue**: Model limitation vs task misclassification
2. **Escalate one tier**: Try the next tier up for the same task
3. **Document failures**: Note model-specific limitations for future routing
4. **Consider capabilities**: Check if model has required capabilities (vision, function-calling, etc.)
5. **Review classification**: Was the task properly classified initially?

**Escalation path:**
```
SIMPLE → MEDIUM → COMPLEX → CRITICAL
```

### 7. Decision Heuristics

Quick classification rules for common patterns:

**SIMPLE tier indicators:**
- Keywords: check, monitor, fetch, get, status, list, summarize
- High-frequency operations (heartbeats, polling)
- Well-defined API calls with minimal logic
- Data extraction without analysis

**MEDIUM tier indicators:**
- Keywords: fix, patch, update, research, analyze, test
- Code changes under ~50 lines
- Single-file modifications
- Research and documentation tasks

**COMPLEX tier indicators:**
- Keywords: build, create, architect, debug, design, integrate
- Multi-file changes or new features
- Complex debugging or troubleshooting
- System design and architecture work

**CRITICAL tier indicators:**
- Keywords: security, production, deploy, financial, audit
- Security-sensitive operations
- Production deployments
- Financial or legal analysis
- High-stakes decision-making

**When in doubt:** Go one tier up. Under-speccing costs more in retries than over-speccing costs in model quality.

### 8. Extended Thinking Modes

Some models support extended thinking/reasoning which improves quality but increases cost:

**Models with thinking support:**
- Anthropic Claude models: Use `thinking="on"` or `thinking="budget_tokens:5000"`
- DeepSeek R1 variants: Built-in chain-of-thought reasoning
- OpenAI o1/o3 models: Native reasoning capabilities

**When to use thinking:**
- COMPLEX tier tasks requiring deep reasoning
- CRITICAL tier tasks where accuracy is paramount
- Multi-step logical problems
- Architecture and design decisions

**When to avoid thinking:**
- SIMPLE tier tasks (wasteful)
- MEDIUM tier routine operations
- High-frequency repetitive tasks
- Tasks where thinking tokens would 2-5x the cost unnecessarily

```python
# Enable thinking for complex architectural work
sessions_spawn(
    task="Design scalable microservices architecture for payment system",
    model="{complex_model}",
    thinking="on",  # or thinking="budget_tokens:5000"
    label="architecture-design"
)
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1: Two-Phase Processing

For large or uncertain tasks, use a cheaper model for initial work, then refine with a better model.

**Note:** Sub-agents are asynchronous — results come back as notifications, not synchronous returns.

```python
# Phase 1: Draft with cheaper model
sessions_spawn(
    task="Draft initial API design document outline",
    model="{simple_model}",
    label="draft-phase"
)

# Wait for draft-phase to complete and write output...

# Phase 2: Refine with capable model (after Phase 1 finishes)
sessions_spawn(
    task="Review and refine the draft at /tmp/api-draft.md, add detailed specs",
    model="{medium_model}",
    label="refine-phase"
)
```

**Savings:** Process bulk content with cheap model, only use expensive model for refinement.

### Pattern 2: Batch Processing

Group multiple similar SIMPLE tasks together to reduce overhead:

```python
# Instead of spawning 10 separate agents:
tasks = [
    "Check server1 status",
    "Check server2 status",
    # ... 10 tasks
]

# Batch them:
sessions_spawn(
    task=f"Run these checks: {', '.join(tasks)}. Report any issues.",
    model="{simple_model}",
    label="batch-monitoring"
)
```

### Pattern 3: Tiered Escalation

Start with MEDIUM tier, escalate to COMPLEX if needed:

```python
# Try MEDIUM first
sessions_spawn(
    task="Debug intermittent test failures in test_auth.py",
    model="{medium_model}",
    label="debug-attempt-1"
)

# If insufficient, escalate:
if debug_failed:
    sessions_spawn(
        task="Deep debug of test_auth.py failures (previous attempt incomplete)",
        model="{complex_model}",
        label="debug-attempt-2"
    )
```

### Pattern 4: Cost-Benefit Analysis

Before routing, consider:

1. **Criticality**: How bad is failure? → Higher criticality = higher tier
2. **Cost delta**: What's the price difference between tiers? → Small delta = lean toward higher tier
3. **Retry costs**: Will failures require retries? → High retry cost = start with higher tier
4. **Time sensitivity**: How urgent is completion? → Urgent = higher tier for speed/reliability

## Using the Router CLI

The included `router.py` script helps with classification and cost estimation:

```bash
# Classify a task and get model recommendation
python scripts/router.py classify "fix authentication bug in login.py"
# Output: Classification: MEDIUM
#         Recommended Model: {medium_model}

# List all configured models
python scripts/router.py models
# Output: Models grouped by tier

# Check configuration health
python scripts/router.py health
# Output: Validates config.json structure

# Estimate task cost
python scripts/router.py cost-estimate "build payment processing system"
# Output: Tier: COMPLEX, Est. tokens: 5000/3000, Cost: $0.060 USD
```

**Integration tip:** Run `router.py classify` before spawning agents to validate your tier selection.

## Configuration Guide

### Setting Up Your Models

1. **Inventory your models**: List all LLM providers and models you have access to
2. **Gather pricing**: Find input/output costs per million tokens from provider docs
3. **Assign tiers**: Map models to SIMPLE/MEDIUM/COMPLEX/CRITICAL based on capability
4. **Document capabilities**: Note what each model can do (vision, function-calling, etc.)
5. **Add notes**: Include limitations or special characteristics

### Example Multi-Provider Config

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "local/ollama-qwen-1.5b",
      "alias": "Local Qwen",
      "tier": "SIMPLE",
      "provider": "ollama",
      "input_cost_per_m": 0.00,
      "output_cost_per_m": 0.00,
      "context_window": 32768,
      "capabilities": ["text"],
      "notes": "Free local model, good for testing and simple tasks"
    },
    {
      "id": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
      "alias": "GPT-4o Mini",
      "tier": "MEDIUM",
      "provider": "openai",
      "input_cost_per_m": 0.15,
      "output_cost_per_m": 0.60,
      "context_window": 128000,
      "capabilities": ["text", "code", "vision"],

    },
    {
      "id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
      "alias": "Claude Sonnet",
      "tier": "COMPLEX",
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "input_cost_per_m": 3.00,
      "output_cost_per_m": 15.00,
      "context_window": 200000,
      "capabilities": ["text", "code", "reasoning", "vision"],
      "notes": "Excellent for complex coding and analysis"
    },
    {
      "id": "anthropic/claude-opus-4",
      "alias": "Claude Opus",
      "tier": "CRITICAL",
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "input_cost_per_m": 15.00,
      "output_cost_per_m": 75.00,
      "context_window": 200000,
      "capabilities": ["text", "code", "reasoning", "vision", "function-calling"],
      "notes": "Best available for critical operations"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] At least one model per tier (SIMPLE, MEDIUM, COMPLEX, CRITICAL)
- [ ] All models have required fields (id, alias, tier, costs, capabilities)
- [ ] Model IDs match your actual provider/model format
- [ ] Costs are accurate per million tokens
- [ ] Tiers make sense relative to each other (SIMPLE cheaper than CRITICAL)
- [ ] Run `python scripts/router.py health` to validate

## Quick Reference Card

**Classification:**
- **"check/monitor/fetch"** → SIMPLE tier
- **"fix/patch/research"** → MEDIUM tier
- **"build/debug/architect"** → COMPLEX tier
- **"security/production/financial"** → CRITICAL tier

**Coding tasks:**
- Simple code → {medium_model} + optional {simple_model} QA
- Complex code → {complex_model} or {critical_model} directly

**Cost optimization:**
- High-volume tasks → cheaper models
- One-off complex tasks → premium models
- When uncertain → estimate both options

**General rule:**
When in doubt, go one tier up — retries cost more than quality.
