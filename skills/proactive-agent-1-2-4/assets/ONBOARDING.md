# ONBOARDING.md — Getting to Know You

> This file tracks onboarding progress. Don't delete it — the agent uses it to resume.

## How This Works

When your agent sees this file with `state: not_started` or `in_progress`, it knows to help you complete setup. You can:

1. **Interactive mode** — Answer questions in one session (~10 min)
2. **Drip mode** — Agent asks 1-2 questions naturally over several days
3. **Skip for now** — Agent works immediately, learns from conversation

Say "let's do onboarding" to start, or "ask me later" to drip.

## After Onboarding

Once complete (or enough answers gathered), the agent will:
1. Update USER.md with your context
2. Update SOUL.md with personality preferences
3. Set status to `complete`
4. Start proactive mode

You can always update answers by editing this file or telling your agent.
